# About

This library aims to standardize the health check messages reported by
dojot's microservices. It follows the specification [draft-inadarei-api-health-check-02]("https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-inadarei-api-health-check-02").

Although developed to be used in the dojot's services, it is a generic libary and 
can be used in any microservice.
